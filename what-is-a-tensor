What is tensor?
This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5liqUk0ZTw&feature=youtu.be
explains well.

To process data efficiently, we want to find a compact way to store data.
Let's see an example, different schools are often different in giving out grades. 
For example, the average score for school 1 is 75 while the average score for school 2 is 90.
To assess student performance across schools, we need to adjust scores from school 1 to a higher grade.
For example, Abby got 80 for her arts class and got 90 for her science class. 
Abby's arts class: 80 which is a number
Abby's arts class, science class: (80, 90) which is a group of numbers
Abby takes classes each year.
(80, 90) <-- year 1
(85, 86) <--- year 2
Suppose we want to record more students' score in her school.
Suppose we want to record students' achievements in more schools.

When we access a student's score, we need to access this way:
Which school, Which student, which year, which subject

You can think a tensor as a warehouse. 
You reach the section marked as "school 1", 
then the sub section of "Abby", 
then the sub section of "year 1",
then the subject "arts".

says "tensors are also a fancy name for n-dimensional arrays".
