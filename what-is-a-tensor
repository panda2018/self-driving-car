1. What is tensor?

explains well.

Abby studies hard and gets good grades. However, her school is very strict in giving out grades.
For example, she gets 4 in her science class which is top of her class.
Her friend goes to a different school and that school tends to give better grades. She worries if she's in a worse position
when applying to colleges.

She wonders whether scores can be adjusted. For example, if the average score of her school is 4 and the average score for
the other school is 5. Then scores at her school can be multiplied by 1.25 before comparing to the scores of the other school.

She took these classes
year 1, cooking, philosophy, physical education
her scores for these classes:
3, 2, 4
year 2, arts, sciences, architecture
her scores: 4, 3, 4

of course, she could write these
3 * 1.25 = 3.75
2 * 1.25 = 2.5
4 * 1.25 = 5

A compact way to express this:
[3 2 4] * 1.25 = [3.75 2.5 5]

a compact way to store data.
different schools are often different in giving out grades. 
To assess student performance across schools, we need to adjust scores from school 1 to a higher grade.

Suppose we want to record more students' score in her school.
Suppose we want to record students' achievements in more schools.

When we access a student's score, we need to access this way:
Which school, Which student, which year, which subject

A good way to note down a group of numbers

You can think a tensor as a warehouse. 
You reach the section marked as "school 1", 
then the sub section of "Abby", 
then the sub section of "year 1",
then the subject "arts".

says "tensors are also a fancy name for n-dimensional arrays".
